# Face-Recognition
Self-study deep learning for face recognition
<br>This repository is a notebook for self-learned face recognition.</br>
The objective is to understand deep learning with the use of face recognition. It's just a beginner etude and the result is quit well but still need to be improved.</br>
The whole dataset limitly has 30 face pictures of mine and 30 face pictures of my friend, so that 60 face pictures in total.
This repository contains: </br>
	1. Build face dataset: Take picture and image processing with OpenCV. </br>
	2. Deep learning: Use Python with kears to build a classifier in order to recognize me and my friend. </br>
	3. Real time video streaming: Apply model into video streaming, detect face and recognize my friend and me in real time.</br>
